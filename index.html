            I love you, Vee. You're my girlfriend now. I don't even have to ask. You fell for it. Fool. I pity you.
            I will risk life, limb, and grief for this. For you. But still, you fell for it. Don't you feel played?
            If I were you I'd feel played. I chose the 29th because it's the extra day of the leap year. That's right.
            No solid anniversary for years. We're the world cup of relationships. Olympic mjolo. we should invest in a torch
            and commit arson.
